    <h1><u>My Future</u></h1>
    <img alt="man performing a chemistry experiment" src="pictures/chem2.jpg" height="300" width="500">
    <hr>
    <p style="color:mediumblue">In the future, I would like to be a chemical engineer since I am fascinated with chemical processes, and it would be a good career for me to test my skills on. As a chemical engineer, I would create and refine chemical manufacturing processes using the principles of chemistry, biology, physics and math, eventually producing many common products. However, the type of chemical engineering used would likely change during my lifetime; as everything gets more and more automated, computer science will likely become a major component of most industries, so I am also focusing on building my skills in that field.</style></p>

    <h3><u>Wish List</u></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>After I get my first job in this career, in addition to whatever my boss wants me to do, I would start research on an alternative form of energy that would function like oil and fossil fuels, but would have similar effects to the environment as renewable, sustainable energy.</li>
      <li>I would purchase a statue of Bill Gates once I get said job as he is not only a great inventor, but also a philanthropist and a great person to model my work after.</li>
